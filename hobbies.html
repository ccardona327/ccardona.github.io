		<p> Cristian enjoys spending time with family and friends. In addition, he has a passion for mathematics
			and music which he has combined by analysing sounds and enjoying melodies from different music genres.
			He likes to read about mathematical content which is unfamiliar to him and he likes to relate it
			to previous knowledge as well as brushing up on already known material.
