			Cristian is a graduate student at Georgia State University. His interest for mathematics started with applied mathematics
			but slowly have merged with pure mathematical concepts. More specific interests include numerical analysis, optimization, 
			real analysis and matrix analysis, among other areas of mathemathics.
			Understanding mathematics has been a crucial part of his education because that is what will make him a better instructor, 
			tutor and peer to those around him. Understanding the subject makes him a stronger mathematician and hopefully better at 
			transferring that knowledge. 
			The department of <a class="bodyLink", href="https://www.mathstat.gsu.edu/", target="_blank"> Mathematics and Statistics at 
			Georgia State University</a> has information about its different programs for those interested in learning more about mathematics. 
			There are also clubs and groups	which hold activies related to the subject, they allow students to meet others with the similar interestes.
