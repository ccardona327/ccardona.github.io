			Cristian is a mathematics instructor in Georgia. His interest for mathematics started with applied mathematics
			but slowly have merged with pure mathematical concepts. More specific interests include numerical analysis, optimization, 
			real analysis and matrix analysis, among other areas of mathemathics.
			Understanding mathematics has been a crucial part of building a passion for mathematics because that is what will make him a better instructor, 
			tutor and peer to those around him.
