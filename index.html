		<h2>Learning mathematics</h2>
		<p> Cristian is a graduate student at Georgia State University. His interests include 
			numerical analysis, optimization, real analysis and matrix analysis, among other 
			areas of mathemathics.
			Understanding mathematics has been a crucial part of his education because that is 
			what will make him a better instructor, tutor and peer to those around him. Understanding
			the subject makes him a stronger mathematician and hopefully better at transferring that knowledge.
